- Internet connection
- Contacted UBC CPSC Tech Staff to give you 'Owner' permissions of course
- Have 'admin' or 'write' permissions to `pl-ubc-course999` course repository, which you likely do if you are reading this.

Read:

1) [Clone this Repository](#clone-this-repository)
2) [Modify this Repository](#modify-this-repository)
3) [Sync this Repository](#sync-this-repository)
4) Follow Get Started guide published by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)
5) DELETE this README.md and implement a README.md for your TAs

## Clone this Repository

You will have the scaffolding necessary for a basic course in Prairie Learn.

- Type command `git clone https://github.ubc.ca/PrairieLearn/pl-ubc-course999` after replacing `course999` with your course short name.
- Substitute the course name with your course.
- Follow the capitalization and naming conventions conventions found on [Prairie Learn Canada](https://ca.prairielearn.org/).

## Modify this Repository

UBC Tech Staff have given you 'Owner' permissions for the Course subject in Prairie Learn Canada. Owner permissions allow you to sync the contents of this Github Repository with the changes that you have implemented.

Once you sync the contents of your course repository, you will be able to create a course instance and complete the Get Started guide published by UIUC.

## Sync this Repository

You will need to import the repository course code to the [Prairie Learn Canada application](https://ca.prairielearn.org) once you are done with your initial configuration.

1) Make sure that the code configuration changes are committed to Git version control.
2) The committed changes are now assumed to be in your local environment. If you have not pushed the code to the remote repository, push your changes now.

Command to push your changes to remote repository: `git push origin master`
