	<p>A floating buoy is anchored to the bottom of a river. As the river flows, the buoy is pulled in the direction of flow until its 2-metre rope is taut. A sensor at the anchor reads the angle $\theta$ between the rope and the riverbed, as shown in the diagram below. This data is used to measure the depth $D$ of water in the river, which depends on time.</p>

	<p>If $\theta={{params.theta}}^{\circ}$ and $\frac{d\theta}{dt}={{params.Dtheta}}\frac{\textrm{rad}}{\textrm{hr}}$, how fast is the depth $D$ of the water changing?</p>
