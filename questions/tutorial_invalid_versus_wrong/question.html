  <p> In PrairieLearn, there is a difference between an invalid and an incorrect input.</p>
  <p> An invalid response does not use up any attempts, but an incorrect response does.</p> 
  <p> a. Type "$x$" in the boxes below and press "Save & Grade." Think about why you received this feedback. </p>
  <p> b. Click the question mark buttons near the input boxes - they are your friend! </p>
  <p> c. Type "$1$" in each of the boxes and press "Save & Grade." Think about how this feedback is different from what you received in part a.</p>
  <p> d. What is $\displaystyle \frac { {{params.a}} } { {{params.b}} }$? Round to the nearest integer for the integer input box. </p>
  <p> Bonus: Note the nuance between the two number input boxes. Press the question mark button to see the subtle difference!</p>
