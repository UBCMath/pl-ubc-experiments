  <p> In PrairieLearn, there is a difference between an <em>invalid input</em> and an <em>incorrect input</em>.</p>
  <p> An invalid response does not use up any attempts, but an incorrect response does.</p>
  <!--  but the questions below do not explore this aspect... -->
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Type an “$x$” in <em>each of the boxes</em> below and press “Save &amp; Grade”.
      Think about the feedback you receive.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the question mark buttons near the input boxes - they are your friend!
    </li>
    <li>
      Type “$1$” in each of the boxes and press “Save &amp; Grade”.
      Think about how this feedback is different from what you received in part a.
    </li>
    <li> What is $\displaystyle \frac { {{params.a}} } { {{params.b}} }$?
      Enter your answer into each box.
      Round to the nearest integer for the integer input box.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p> Bonus: Note the nuance between the two number input boxes. Press the question mark button to see the subtle difference!</p>
