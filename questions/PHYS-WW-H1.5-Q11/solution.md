# Physics WebWork H1.5 Q11

* Container undergoes an isothermal compression, so it obeys Boyle's law, $P_1V_1=P_2V_2$.
* Container compressed to half its initial volume, so we have $V_2 = \frac{V_1}{2}$, and consequently $P_2=2P_1$, with temperature unchanged.
* Next compression is isobaric, so it follows Charles's law, $\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}$.
* Compression halves the volume yet again, so we have $V_2 = \frac{V_1}{2}$ again, and as such, $T_2 = \frac{T_1}{2}$.
