    Two cans of pineapples,
    one empty and one unopened,
    sit beside each other on a table next to a slope.
    James knocks them both over,
    and the two cans roll down the slope at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which can reaches the bottom of the slope first?

    The cans weigh ${{params.m_can}} \; \textrm{g}$ when empty,
    and the sliced pineapples themselves (excluding the can) weigh ${{params.m_pa}} \; \textrm{g}$.
    They were bought at the supermarket at a price of $\$ 1.49$ each,
    and they both expired two weeks ago.
    The unopened can of pineapples are so tightly packed
    such that there is no wiggle room,
    and nothing moves no matter how hard you shake the can.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the cans roll a distance of ${{params.d}} \; \textrm{cm}$,
    and the slope forms an angle of ${{params.theta}}^\circ$ with the ground,
    find the speed of both cans the moment they reach the bottom of the slope,
    assuming no work is done by friction.
