# CLP1 3.3 Q8

The mass of a sample of Polonium–210, initially $m_i$ grams, decreases at a rate proportional to the mass. After $t_f$ years, $m_f$ grams remain. What is the half–life (the time it takes for the sample to decay to half its original mass)?

## Solution

* $$\frac{dQ}{dt} = -kQ$$
* $$Q(t) = Ce^{-kt}$$
* $$Q(0) = m_i = C$$
* $$Q(t) = m_ie^{-kt}$$
* $$Q(t_f) = m_f = m_ie^{-kt_f}$$
* $$k = \frac{\ln{\frac{m_i}{m_f}}}{t_f}$$
* $$Q(t_{\frac{1}{2}}) = \frac{m_i}{2} = m_ie^{-kt_{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
* $$t_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\ln{2}}{k}$$
