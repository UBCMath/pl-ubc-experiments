  <p> In PrairieLearn, there is a difference between an <em>invalid input</em> and an <em>incorrect input</em>.</p>
  <p>
    Different types of inputs have different rules about this.
  </p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Type an “$x$” in <em>each of the boxes</em> below and press “Save &amp; Grade”.
      Think about the feedback you receive.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the question mark buttons near the input boxes - they are your friend!
    </li>
    <li>
      Type “<tt>1</tt>” in each of the boxes and press “Save &amp; Grade”.
      Think about how this feedback is different from what you received in part a.
    </li>
    <li>
      Type “<tt>1/2</tt>” in each of the boxes and press “Save &amp; Grade”.
      Think about the feedback.
      You should also explore the grey “Why?” buttons that appear after you submit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Type “<tt>0.6</tt>” in each of the boxes and press “Save &amp; Grade”.
      Think about the feedback.
      Again, explore the grey “Why?” buttons that appear.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <!--<p>
    Some of those inputs were wrong and some were invalid.
    But none were correct because we didn’t tell you the question!
  </p>-->
  <h4>Applying what we’ve learned</h4>
  <p>What is $\displaystyle \frac { {{params.a}} } { {{params.b}} }$?
    Enter an appropriate answer into each box: you may need to
    format or round appropriately.
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
    Bonus: Note the nuance between the two number input boxes. Press the question mark button to see the subtle difference!
  </p>
  -->
  <!--
  <p>
    Bonus: experiment with leaving some of the boxes blank: this is usually invalid but sometimes the question-author will configure this to simply be wrong.
  </p>
  -->
  <p>
    One difference to note is that an invalid response does not use up
    any of our “attempts”, but an incorrect response does.
    This can be important in an assessment situation: it means any
    improperly-formatted (but otherwise correct) answers do not count against us.

    <br /> <!-- why?! -->

    In summary, we have learned that PairieLearn can be very particular about how we format our answers.
    We saw a contrast between invalid answers and incorrect answers, and learned a bit about “debugging” our submissions.
